  text1="For this project it was required to create a vector illustration within an isometric grid. The illustration would need to be showing some kind of process."
  text2="I started off by brainstorming a list of ideas that I could potentially consider for this project. Since food is the love of my life, I decided to incorporate my favourite dessert for my illustration process...DONUTS! "
  text3="There were a few struggles along the way when it came to how I was going to execute this process.
