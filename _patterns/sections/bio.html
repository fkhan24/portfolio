    <p class="about-text">My love for art and creativity is what motivated me to pursue a career as a graphic designer. To me, being a designer means that there is no limit. I take pride in my work and want to be able to use my art to visually communicate with others. I have a great sense of humour and get along well with others. In my spare time I enjoy eating, netlfixing, reading, drawing, and spending time with my friends and family. If you take the time to know me you’ll learn that sarcasm runs through my veins and food is the key to my heart or stomach…especially doughnuts!</p>
