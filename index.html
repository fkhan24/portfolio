I started off my path into the design world with an interest in visual arts throughout high school. Becoming a graphic designer really helped me discover that I could do more with my illustrations. Since then, I’ve come to love everything that has to do with branding, illustration, packaging, and hand lettering. " text2="When I’m not staring at my laptop all day, I enjoy being outdoors, painting, cooking and eating, watching TV shows and spending time with my family. I am an addict for Coca Cola, donuts, ice cream and cute animals. " text3="As a designer, I believe that we have the opportunity to connect with the rest of the world and help others. I take pride in my work and want to create unique designs that can help make a difference. " text3="Interested in my work? Let's talk!" %}
