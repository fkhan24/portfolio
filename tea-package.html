{% pattern sections/project-text header="24/7 Tea" subhead="Logo · Packaging" target="The demographic for this product is targeted towards young to middle-aged adults who prefer tea as their daily choice of beverage." text1="When I think of tea, what comes to mind is culture and taste. Growing up in a household where tea was always served, it always makes me think of the warmth and comfort of home. Tea is widely consumed in different parts of the world and commonly in East and South Asia. There’s not only a wide variety of tastes and flavours, it is also known to have many health benefits and works well for detox. As a heavy tea drinker myself, I wanted to create a package design that would introduce organic ingredients, as well as the origin of each individual tea flavour." %}

    <h4 class="push-0">Challenges</h4>
    <p class="main-text milli">While creating my brand, I struggled with my overall concepts for the design of the box. I knew that I wanted to incorporate a rustic organic look to the pattern of my die line, but wasn’t quite sure on how to execute the illustrations and colours, without making it look too flashy. I originally created illustrations that had geometric elements to the design, but with the hand-etched logo, it didn’t reflect the goal that I was going for. With another round of sketches, I was able to produce illustrations of the ingredient that I had sketched by hand with a brush pen and import it into illustrator to get that final result.</p>
